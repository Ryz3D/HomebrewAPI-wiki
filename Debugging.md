# Debugging Lua Code
This is a tough one, since the lua you're making is very Homebrew specific (in most cases), it can be rather tough to debug values.. 

Thankfully, we supply everyone with a Console (´´home key`` to toggle it on/off), which will log each Debug message you put in.

It's fairly easy to send specific kind of logs using the default Unity "Debug" class

```lua
Debug.Log("This is a regular log")
Debug.LogWarning("This is a warning")
Debug.LogError("This is an error")
```

this will result in these messages in your console.

this might not be the _handiest_ way for debugging though, as it requires you to be outside of a vehicle to toggle on/off. 

The other way you can debug is via local chat messages! 

This is rather simple to implement, first we need to get the chat, then call a function to send a message. 

Keep in mind this is **only locally**, so don't try spamming the chat, it won't do anything for other players. 

```lua
self.chat = GameObject.FindObjectOfType("HBChat")
self.debug = function(msg) self.chat:AddMessage("[DEBUG]",msg) end 
```

Then we can call it as such 
```lua
if Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.P) then 
  self.debug("You pressed P!")
end 
``` 
and it will look something like this

As you can probably tell, this can be fairly handy in a lot of situations. 

You can even add custom color coding to it if you want, let's change our original setup, and do that now. 

```lua
self.chat = GameObject.FindObjectOfType("HBChat")
self.log      = function(msg) self.chat:AddMessage("[DEBUG]",msg, "ffffff") end 
self.error    = function(msg) self.chat:AddMessage("[DEBUG]",msg, "cc0000") end 
self.warning  = function(msg) self.chat:AddMessage("[DEBUG]",msg, "ffff00") end 
```

this makes it a bit easier to quickly see if it's an error, warning, or a regular log. 

We can also just change our 'name' value (``[DEBUG]``) to specify if it's a log, error, or warning, you could even colorize them quite easily! 

```lua
self.error    = function(msg) self.chat:AddMessage("<color=#cc0000>[DEBUG]</color>",msg) end 
```
which will result in the name being red

I think that's enough for now about regular text debugging. 

**TODO: Add visual debugging, aka drawing cubes/circles/squares on screen, along with GUI elements for real-time visual debugging**
